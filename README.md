# DataConveyer_LoadSparseData

DataConveyer_LoadSparseData is a console application to demonstrate how Data Conveyer can be
used to generate SQL scripts to load data into a database.

It can be thought of as an "intelligent BCP script" ([BCP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility?view=sql-server-2017) = Bulk Copy Program) that evaluates
large input text file "on the fly" and decides what data needs to be loaded. Custom logic is
used to filter out unwanted records, remove unneded data elements, perform calculations, such
as data decryption, etc.

Such data loader (pre-scrubber) can be helpful when large datasets get loaded into a database
for ad-hoc analyses. When it is known up-front that many records/elements are irrelevant to
such analyses, it may be sensible to only load those items that are relevant.

This somewhat contrived example assumes an input data to contain a list of people with many
extraneous fields and many records missing data (and as such being irrelevant). Like so:

```
Id      Key            Code                              Filler1                                  FName       LName               DOB       Filler2                                         Hash                                                            Filler3         Street                       City                   StateZip  Phone         Email                                 Guid                                Filler4                                             EncSsn

```

Upon execution, a new file will be created with SQL script that loads only relevant data into
the database. Like so:

```sql
CREATE TABLE MyPeople (ID char(12), LastName char(20), FirstName char(12), SSN char(11))
GO
INSERT INTO MyPeople VALUES('xR7So1sVc', 'Shakspeare', 'Aloin', '753-99-7347')
```

## Installation

* Fork this repository and clone it onto your local machine, or

* Download this repository onto your local machine.

## Usage

1. Open DataConveyer_LoadSparseData application in Visual Studio.

2. Build and run the application, e.g. hit F5

    - a console window with directions will show up.

3. Copy an input file (SparseData.txt extracted from SparseData.zip) into the ...Data\In folder

    - the file will get processed as reported in the console window.

4. Review the contents of the output file placed in the ...Data\Out folder.

5. (optional) Repeat steps 3-4 for other additional input file(s).

6. To exit application, hit Enter key into the console window.

**Note:** If you  experience *"InitializationError"* after copying the input file in step 3, it
most likely happens because the file is still being copied (and hence locked) when Data&nbsp;Conveyer
attempts to start processing. To circumvent this condition, you can try moving the file (from a location
on the same partition) instead of copying it. It this doesn't help, then consider refactoring
the code like in the [DataConveyer_FilterLargeCsvData](https://github.com/mavidian/DataConveyer_FilterLargeCsvData)
repository, where the process start is deferred until explicit user action.
